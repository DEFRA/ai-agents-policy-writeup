I think on the back of our conversation there, I need to add something around the separation of concerns for the different artefacts to the playbook... something like  

- cursor rules - concerned with standards, patterns and conventions. Stuff that's repeatable across prompts and codebases.
- the requirements document -concerned with defining (with great detail and clarity) what the functional and pseudo technical requirements are
- the prompt - the detailed ask for a given task. It can refer to the rules and the requirements if it does there's no need to repeat whats in them.




Initial idea for a table in the playbook  - the three key artefacts to generate code well: 

| Artifact                                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Where created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
