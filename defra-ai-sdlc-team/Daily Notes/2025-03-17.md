I think on the back of our conversation there, I need to add something around the separation of concerns for the different artefacts to the playbook... something like  

- cursor rules - concerned with standards, patterns and conventions. Stuff that's repeatable across prompts and codebases.
- the requirements document -concerned with defining (with great detail and clarity) what the functional and pseudo technical requirements are
- the prompt - the detailed ask for a given task. It can refer to the rules and the requirements if it does there's no need to repeat whats in them.




Initial idea for a table in the playbook  - the three key artefacts to generate code well: 

| Artifact                                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Where created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# To be added to the playbook - how to get started

# Node extract files prd

We have an existing node.js api and would like to add a new endpoint to it that will accept a github repository and a list of file paths, then call a library called Repomix to fetch an xml representation of the files in the repository.

## Context

We already have a helper class that calls the Repomix library called execute-repomix.js.

## New functionality

We want to create new POST route to `/api/v1/repo-files` that will have the following as an input: `{'repository_url' : string, 'file_paths': string }`. The `file_paths` will be a comma-delimited string that we will pass straight through to the execute-repomix.js helper function, as defined below.

The endpoint will then perform the following steps:

1. Initialize the execute-repomix.js helper function with the following  configuration: 
```
const config = {
	output: {
		filePath: outputFile,
		style: 'xml',
		parsableStyle: false,
		compress: false,
		fileSummary: false,
		directoryStructure: true,
		removeComments: false,
		removeEmptyLines: false,
		showLineNumbers: false,
		copyToClipboard: false,
		includeEmptyDirectories: false
	},
	include: [{{file_paths}}],
	ignore: {
		useGitignore: true,
		useDefaultPatterns: true,
		customPatterns: []
	},
	security: {
		enableSecurityCheck: false // Disable security check for API usage
	}
}
```

2. Call the repomix helper with the above configuration and the `repository_url` that was passed into the api using this function: `executeRepomix = async (repositoryUrl, options = {})`
3. The `/api/v1/repo-files` will then return the raw output of the `executeRepomix` call to the user.
