Thoughts for the playbook
- for repo-specific examples - should be in the cursorrules, but have more general prompts
- Have a testing cursorrules is needed to be specific (need to have a section about the different cursorrules files with globs)
- note in playbook about general prompts vs repo-specific prompting
- I like the format of:

```
INITIAL RULES:
ANALYSIS PHASE:
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
VERIFICATION AND COMPLETION PHASE:
```
