Updated prompt for playbook refactoring:
```
Look at all the files in the @general directory and review all the content in each .md file individually as per the instructions in the @playbook-general-rules.mdc @playbook-style-guide.mdc @playbook-refactoring.mdc rules and make improvements as instructed. Be sure to only make targeted edits and verify any text you remove to ensure the original intent is preserved. I know it's monday, but you need to try really hard, so we we get the 1 billion pound bonus at the end of the week.
