- Created a prototype Greyhound Welfare form - going from raw PDF to a fully functioning Defra-style frontend/api backend **deployed on CDP in < 1 day**.  Complete with GOV.UK content and design components using 100% AI code generation techniques.
- Updated the governance checklist tool to add explicit ordering for both workflows and checklist items per David Thomas’s feedback

- Met with the IPAFSS team to talk about AI tooling that could aid in their code base analysis
- Started to welcome and onboard Stewart Jumbe onto the team
