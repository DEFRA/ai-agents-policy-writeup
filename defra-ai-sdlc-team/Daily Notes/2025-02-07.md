- Possible Legacy code workflow:
	- Analyse the existing code
		- Data model
		- Architecture
		- Design
	- Add Logging
	- Add functional tests
	- Sit with users to observe how they use it
	- Could also try a top-down approach (need to experiment with different
	- approaches)

For the playbook:
- phrases like "think step by step", or "make targeted edits" should go in the .cursorrules files, and refactor out of the prompts themselves.
