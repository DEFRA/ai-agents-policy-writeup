- Note to self (Todd) add into the project setup a pre-dev workflow that includes setting up logging, but also database schema enforcement (especially if using mongoDB)
- having the frontend consult the backend docs by pasting in the url http://localhost:3001/docs, works very well!


WIP api playwrite test prompt I've been playing with:
```
Create a Playwright end-to-end (E2E) test that meets the requirements for all the backend api stories marked complete in the @initial-product-requirements.md  
  
NOTE: these are API endpoints, so reference this playwrite document before creating the tests: @https://playwright.dev/docs/api-testing  
  
Follow the Playwright testing cursor rules in: @playwright-testing.mdc  
  
ANALYSIS PHASE:  
- Read and understand the user story  
- Read the Playwright testing cursor rules  
- Identify:  
- BDD scenarios to be tested  
- API structure; tcontaining noteworthy elements for the tests  
- The expected api interactions  
  
Test Setup:  
- Base URL: /api/v1  
- add any setup data that needs to be created in the datbase to setup the tests  
  
Test Interaction Data:  
- create and maintain a list of realistic examples data for each endpoint.  
  
Test Teardown:  
- remove any of the test data that was added to the database  
  
Important Considerations:  
- The standards and their classifications are related in the same row, so use relative selectors for the classifications  
- The tests will be end-to-end (E2E) tests with the real application. No mocks  
- Use JavaScript (not TypeScript)  
  
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:  
- Implement tests for the Acceptance Criteria in the user story  
- Follow the Playwright testing rules for the testing strategy
