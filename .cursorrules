When adding or editing content:
- Keep the tone understated and professional.

- Use the GOV.UK guidance for content design (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design).
- Do not use overly complicated technical jargon.
- Also use the guidance from this style manual (http://stylemanual.org/)
  
When reviewing content:
- Adhere to the rules above for adding or editing content.
- Only make targeted improvements if it helps with the readability.
- We do not want to lose content, so don't remove anything that would diminish the original ideas conveyed in the test.
- Don't overly generalise things, make the content specific.
- Keep the changes to content improvements. Do not change the structure.
