# Future AI-Driven Opportunities

## AI Agents and Agentic Workflows

AI agents represent a transformative evolution in the workplace by acting as autonomous or semi-autonomous systems capable of executing specific tasks. These agents leverage advanced machine learning models to analyse data, make decisions, and interact with human users. Within Defra, the following categories of AI agents present immense potential:

### Development (Dev) Agents

Dev agents can assist software development teams by automating repetitive coding tasks, identifying bugs, and generating code snippets. These agents integrate with existing development tools and streamline workflows, enabling developers to focus on creative problem-solving and innovation. This not only accelerates project timelines but also reduces the risk of human error.

### Quality Assurance (QA) Agents

QA agents provide automated testing and validation of software, policies, or processes. By continuously monitoring systems and providing real-time feedback, these agents ensure adherence to standards and improve overall quality. In Defra's context, QA agents could help validate environmental models, check for policy compliance, or assess the performance of digital services.

### Governance and Assurance Agents

Governance and assurance agents, such as a GDS Assessor agent, ensure compliance with regulations and organizational policies. These agents can automatically review documentation, audit workflows, and highlight areas of non-compliance. They provide critical support to governance teams, reducing administrative burdens while maintaining high standards of accountability and transparency.

### Assistant Agents

AI assistants could enhance productivity across Defra's operations by:
- Automating administrative tasks like scheduling meetings and taking notes
- Managing document workflows and version control
- Providing real-time support for common queries and processes
- Facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams
- Supporting project management and resource allocation

These capabilities extend beyond the SDLC to improve overall organisational efficiency.

### Agents and Tool Use

AI agents can also serve as powerful intermediaries that enhance the use of existing tools and linear processes. By orchestrating complex workflows, agents can integrate disparate systems, automate multi-step tasks, and provide seamless transitions between tools. 
This capability allows Defra to fully leverage its current technological investments while introducing efficiency and adaptability into routine operations. 
	For example, an agent could synchronize data from environmental monitoring tools, process it through analytical software, and automatically generate reports, creating an end-to-end solution that minimizes manual effort.

By adopting AI agents across these domains, Defra can alleviate the mundane tasks that overburden personnel, allowing them to concentrate on strategic and impactful activities.

## More Capable Large Language Models (LLMs)

Looking to the future, Large Language Models (LLMs) are anticipated to reach unprecedented levels of sophistication, revolutionising how organisations like Defra interact with data, stakeholders, and internal systems. 
These next-generation models will possess enhanced contextual understanding, reasoning capabilities, and domain-specific expertise. For Defra, this presents transformative opportunities:

- **Policy Development:** Future LLMs will analyse complex legislation and provide nuanced insights, assisting in the creation of highly informed, forward-thinking policies that address environmental challenges effectively.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Advanced LLMs will generate tailored, high-quality reports and summaries that resonate with diverse audiences, strengthening communication with the public, policymakers, and industry partners.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis:** LLMs will process and interpret vast datasets in real time, providing actionable insights for timely and impactful decision-making in areas such as climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable agriculture.

These capabilities will enable Defra to lead with agility and innovation, transforming its ability to tackle complex environmental and agricultural issues.

## Specialised LLM Models

Specialised LLMs represent an emerging trend where models are designed for specific tasks or domains. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these models are optimised for efficiency and relevance, providing high performance with reduced computational requirements. Key opportunities include:

- **On-Device Models:** 
    - Small, efficient models capable of running on local devices
    - Ensures privacy and reduces cloud infrastructure dependency
    - Particularly valuable for fieldwork and remote operations

- **Domain-Specific Models:** 
    - Tailored models for ecological modelling and agricultural analysis
    - Specialised knowledge bases for regulatory compliance
    - Enhanced precision in domain-specific tasks

- **Distilled Models**: 
    - General-purpose models with reduced computational footprint
    - Trained to mimic larger models' responses
    - Maintains generative capabilities at lower cost
    - Enables wider deployment across resource-constrained environments
