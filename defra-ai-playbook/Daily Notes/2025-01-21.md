- Keep making documentation about elements like the data model. As you are hands off it’s really easy to lose track of what is going on.
- Constantly refactoring code is a must to keep consistency of style high. Else you’ll get different ways of doing things.
- Do you want relatively small files to ensure differential chunking?
- Using git diff is essential to see the changes made
- Keeping all the context of the app in your head is really hard - This is an unsolved problem
- Windsurf chat has a really good ability to critique codebases without changing files

**Do we want to make a check-structures style prompt**
- Define how the data model looks directly from the DB
- Define how the data model looks based on the docs
- Define how the data model looks based on the code usage
- Compare and contrast and create a report of the difference

**Do we want to do the same with some of the other logic too??**

**Hypothesis** - we are experiencing multiple smaller changes to the codebase eventually changing many files leading to issues - We think that this might be that AI tools are speeding up this loop which makes it appear like it's constantly needing refactoring.
