# IDE’s

This channel does some great videos on Cursor and Windsurf - [https://www.youtube.com/@YifanBTH](https://www.youtube.com/@YifanBTH) - including tips on prompting complex code bases and on .cursorrules files

Cursor and windsurf use RAG for their agents. Context is a key consideration when using these agentic IDE's. This is a good article about that [https://codeium.com/blog/context-aware-everything-more-advanced-realtime-context-than-github-copilot](https://codeium.com/blog/context-aware-everything-more-advanced-realtime-context-than-github-copilot)

For the latest libraries (e.g. [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)) cursor can index them using @docs and/or search for the latest using @web - windsurf doesn't have this feature yet (6.1.25) [https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/basic](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/basic)

.cursorrules for python

This is a useful ref too [https://gist.github.com/yifanzz/3cfb8f9065769ffbf94348255f85597d](https://gist.github.com/yifanzz/3cfb8f9065769ffbf94348255f85597d) 


# Initial project setup

- If using CDP, go via the CDP portal to setup the project as instructed
- If not using CDP, then create a github repo
- Clone the github repo code locally
- IF USING OBSIDIAN… create obsidian vault
- Remove the welcome file
- (optional) fix the appearance to be ‘Minimal’ or another template
- Files and links….
- Change “Default location for new notes” = “Same folder as current file”
- Change “Default location for new attachments” = “in subfolder under current folder” (leave folder name unchanged as ‘attachments’)
- Turn on community plugins and reload
- Browse community plugins, install and enable the following:
- Excalidraw
- Kanban
- Git

- Git options… “Custom base path (git repository path)” = ‘../’
- Create ‘product-requirements’ folder in the root of the vault
- Create ‘architecture’ folder in the root of the vault
- (optional) create kanban board for project todos
- Add the vault folder to the .prettierignore file (e.g. codereview-frontend-vault)
- Go to the defra-ai-sdlc repository, and download the .cursorrules and prompts for your programming environment
- Copy default-prompts for your programming language into the obsidian directory if using obsidian
- copy .cursorrules for you programming language into the root directory
- Commit obsidian code
- Add the obsidian workspace.json file to the .gitignore (e.g. codereview-frontend-vault/.obsidian/workspace.json)
- Fixing the mermaid width issue in obsidian: [https://unmesh.dev/post/obsidian_mermaid/#:~:text=By%20adjusting%20the%20CSS%20styles,control%20and%20better%20rendering%20options](https://unmesh.dev/post/obsidian_mermaid/#:~:text=By%20adjusting%20the%20CSS%20styles,control%20and%20better%20rendering%20options).
- Don’t use too many credits when doing dev - use subsets of data

# Some Agentic AI Findings over Christmas

[https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) - great paper framing AI Agents. Lots of great stuff including a distinction between workflows vs agents, and workflow patterns

Frameworks - tried out AutoGen and PhiData.  The later seemed better for our current cases, but it’s not really adding much other than a programming API. The paper above advises against frameworks, especially for production code 

Anthropics [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) looks very promising though. It basically gives an elegant and standardised way of using [tools](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) in the Anthropic API. You create “MCP Servers” and implement “list_tools” and “call_tool” API’s. Then the MCP client creates a session and calls these “list_tools” and “call_tool” API’s when interacting with the anthropic tools API.

# Coding Design Choices by the LLM

Cursor seems to start coding with an object oriented approach when coding Python. The rationale being that the initial libraries we used favor OO approaches. An area to monitor would be when we start using libraries where the community favors other approaches will get a mismatch in coding style throughput the repo.

We assume we could change or force the style with prompting in the .cursorrules file if needed
