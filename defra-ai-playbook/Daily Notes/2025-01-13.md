# Adding features to existing codebase
- each feature should be it's own PRD workflow, targeted to that smaller, more specific, change
- summarize what already exists in the codebase, also tell it things to exclude as much as include!

# Steps to do at the end of a feature branch
TDD: Check if the test and the code need refactoring at the end of the feature (once the tests are passing) - Red/Greed refactor pattern
Prompt: Review the tests and see if you can improve them. I'd like them to be easy to read and understand. it should be very clear what the functionality is that they're testing

Add prompt library to the playbook repo

make sure you 'accept all changes', then do a code review / revisions in git before pushing
