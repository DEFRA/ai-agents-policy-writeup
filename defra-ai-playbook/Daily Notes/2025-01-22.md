Notes on how to do a git merge and replace changes:

Also reference: https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules

To ensure that all changes from **branch A** (the newer branch) overwrite any conflicting changes in **branch B** (the older branch) when merging **branch A into branch B**, you can use the following steps. However, **`git checkout --ours`** alone won't help, as it resolves conflicts by keeping changes from the **current branch** (in this case, branch B). Instead, you'll need to use **`git checkout --theirs`** to prioritize the changes from branch A (the branch being merged).

Here's how to do it step-by-step:

### Steps to Overwrite Conflicts with Branch A's Changes

1. **Switch to branch B** (the branch you want to merge into):
    
    ```bash
    git checkout B
    ```
    
2. **Start the merge** of branch A into branch B:
    
    ```bash
    git merge A
    ```
    
    Git will detect conflicts and pause the merge process.
    
3. **Resolve conflicts by keeping branch A's changes** (theirs):
    
    ```bash
    git checkout --theirs .
    ```
    
    This replaces all conflicting files in branch B with the versions from branch A.
    
4. **Stage the resolved files**:
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    
5. **Commit the merge**:
    
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```
    
6. **Verify the result** (optional): Confirm that branch B now contains all of branch Aâ€™s changes.

### Explanation of Commands

- **`git checkout --theirs`**: Resolves conflicts by keeping the changes from the branch being merged (branch A in this case).
- **`git add .`**: Stages the resolved files for commit.
- **`git commit`**: Completes the merge process.

### Alternative: If There Are No Uncommitted Changes

If branch B is clean (no uncommitted changes), you can also force branch B to mirror branch A after the merge by resetting it:

```bash
git merge A
git reset --hard A
```

This effectively makes branch B identical to branch A.
