- make sure you setup the verbose logging as one of the first things!
- set log level to DEBUG when developing, to get the most verbose output to add to the IDE for debugging.
- add swagger documentation
- add pip freeze to get the latest versions of all the packages - add to .cursorrules?
	- is this a custom script? add to .cursorrules?  Need to trial / review
	- updated version of pinning bash line: ```cp requirements.txt requirements.tmp && for pkg in $(cat requirements.tmp); do base_pkg=$(echo "$pkg" | sed 's/\[.*\]//g' | cut -d'=' -f1 | cut -d'>' -f1 | cut -d'<' -f1); pip freeze | grep -i "^${base_pkg}\[.*\]==\|^${base_pkg}=="; done > requirements.tmp.new && mv requirements.tmp.new requirements.txt && rm requirements.tmp```
- need to restart your terminal when .env is updated
- make sure you add @docs docs to add to any prompts for implementing features
- use @web if needed
- make sure you add more than just error logs into the composer, include the previous positive logs so the composer can work out where the issue is

- Spending time learning and throwing away, has value, maybe add a bit in the playbook about that mindset

## Implementing feature workflow
1. create new branch
2. PRD prompt creation
	1. create prd in gpt o1
3. review and run prd implementation prompt, include @rules.md file and link to the `architecture` folder
4. Accept code changes, use git diffs for validation
5. fix errors and test
6. add tests and ensure they pass
	1. creating tests for specific files is more targeted and less likely to go wrong
7. ensure code coverage is good
8. update documentation
9. update readme and/or .cursorrules file if needed
10. check in branch and create PR
11. merge PR and remove branch
12. Consider taking the prompt generated and output and feed it back in to an llm to ask how it would improve the prompt (feedback loop)

## Tree

The `tree` command isn't installed by default on macOS, but I can help you get it set up. Here's how:

1. First, install Homebrew if you don't already have it. You can check by running:

bash

Copy

`brew --version`

If you don't have Homebrew, install it with:

bash

Copy

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

2. Then install tree using Homebrew:

bash

Copy

`brew install tree`

3. Once installed, you can use tree by simply typing:

bash

Copy

`tree`

Some useful options:

- `tree -L 2` (shows only 2 levels deep)
- `tree -a` (shows hidden files)
- `tree -d` (shows only directories)
- `tree -I "node_modules"` (excludes node_modules directory)

Would you like me to explain any specific tree options in more detail?
