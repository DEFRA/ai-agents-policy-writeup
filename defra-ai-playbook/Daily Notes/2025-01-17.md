# Possible good prompts for writing test

Ben's version (proven)

Adding a new test prompt. Note that more the specific the scope of the test the better the result

```
Create new unit tests for [feature or file or code bock in file]. 

No not change the source code being tested. 
  
Follow the testing approach and conventions in [test file]

Make sure you understand the functionality being tested BEFORE wrtiting the tests.

**Important:** Provide the final test code as a single, complete snippet that satisfies all requirements on the first try. Do not provide multiple revisions or partial code—just the single final version. If you need to reason internally, do so silently.
```

then after the doom loop (needs trying out)
```
now the tests are green. check them to see if they need be refectored.  I'd like them to be easy to read and understand. it should be very clear what the functionality is that they're testing. Do not change the source code being tested.
```

Possible good prompts for writing tests (to be evaluated):
```
Below is an **example "ideal prompt"** you can adapt to your own needs. It demonstrates how to specify your environment, lint rules, testing framework, and success criteria in a single request. Adjust the function name, code snippet, lint rules, and version numbers as needed for your specific context.

## Example Prompt

> **Prompt:**  
>   
> I have a function in `src/calculateTotal.js` that looks like this:
> ```js
> // src/calculateTotal.js
> export function calculateTotal(prices) {
>   if (!Array.isArray(prices)) {
>     throw new Error('Prices must be an array')
>   }
>   return prices.reduce((sum, price) => sum + price, 0)
> }
> ```
> 
> **Environment & Dependencies:**
> - Node 16
> - Jest 29
> - ESLint with the following rules:
>   ```json
>   {
>     "env": {
>       "browser": true,
>       "es2021": true
>     },
>     "extends": "eslint:recommended",
>     "parserOptions": {
>       "ecmaVersion": 12,
>       "sourceType": "module"
>     },
>     "rules": {
>       "quotes": ["error", "single"],
>       "semi": ["error", "never"],
>       "no-unused-vars": ["error"]
>     }
>   }
>   ```
> 
> **Task:**  
> 1. Write a single Jest test file named `calculateTotal.test.js`.  
> 2. It must include **at least** 3 test cases:
>    - Normal usage (e.g., `[10, 20, 30] → 60`).
>    - Empty array (should return `0`).
>    - Invalid input (should throw an error).
> 3. Ensure the test code passes ESLint with **zero** warnings or errors under the above lint rules.  
> 4. The test must pass when running `npm test` in Node 16.  
> 5. Include a brief explanation (1–3 sentences) of how the code meets the lint and correctness requirements.  
> 
> **Important:** Provide the final test code as a single, complete snippet that satisfies all requirements on the first try. Do not provide multiple revisions or partial code—just the single final version. If you need to reason internally, do so silently.

### Why This Prompt Works

1. **Specifies the existing code**: The AI sees exactly what function it's testing and how it's written.  
2. **Defines the environment**: Node version, Jest version, etc.  
3. **Includes lint rules explicitly**: This eliminates guesswork about semicolons, quotes, and unused variables.  
4. **Sets exact success criteria**: Pass ESLint, pass tests, test multiple scenarios, etc.  
5. **Limits iteration**: By requesting a single final code snippet, you're telling the AI to "think before writing" and produce the best possible answer in one shot.

Feel free to tailor any part of this example prompt to match your project specifics. By offering the AI everything it needs up front and insisting on a single final code snippet, you greatly reduce the risk of ending up in a back-and-forth "doom loop."
```

And...
```
Specify the testing framework and style guide upfront. For example: "Write tests using Jest following the Airbnb style guide. Tests should use describe/it blocks and follow these lint rules: [specific rules]"
Request complete working examples first. Instead of asking for just test files, ask for both the implementation and corresponding tests together. This helps ensure compatibility.
Be explicit about assertions and edge cases: "Write tests that cover these edge cases: null inputs, empty arrays, invalid types. Use expect().toBe() style assertions and avoid deprecated methods."
Request step-by-step test planning. Before generating code, ask the AI to outline:

What scenarios need testing
What assertions will verify each case
What setup/teardown is needed
What mocking approach to use


For Cursor AI specifically, try this prompt structure:

Please write tests for [component/function] that:
- Use [framework] with strict typing
- Follow [style guide] conventions
- Include setup/teardown in beforeEach/afterEach
- Mock external dependencies using [approach]
- Cover these scenarios: [list]
```




This is an example of fixing a test first time. whereas just running all tests and askign it to fix resulted in a doom loop
``` 
this test is failing. to fix it, consider how the other tests are testing similar functionality. Come up with a plan before implementing the fix. Think it through step by step.

Todd's magic prompt to help the code self-heal some tests:
```
plese fix this single error, don't fix other errors.  consider first if the test is correct.  first run the tests only for the given error (only run tests for that single test file), then think step by step to fix.  run the tests to confirm your fix:

[single failed test line you want it to fix]
```
