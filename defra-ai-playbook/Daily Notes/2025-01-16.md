- Tests seem to get into a doom loop where they pass, then fail linting, then go down rabbit holes - real time suck.
- add to the playbook... project setup: you need to deliberately ask to setup the test framework, logging, linting from the .cursorrules file at the start of the project
- Linting, formatting, commit hooks for python api backend
	- pylint --rcfile=/path/to/.pylintrc src tests
- Is there a 'best' sequence to code quality after the files are written and working? e.g. first fix linting (type errors), then fix tests, then run formatting?

A lot of people are saying run them in parallel but if your are paying for your CI/CD by the minute like on GitHub actions then you might not want to waste the minutes.

I usually run Formatters --> Linters --> Static Code Anayalyis --> Unit --> Functional in that order.

While I do run these in CI, I try to run as much as possible locally before committing and while actually writing the code. I use tools like `pre-commit` to do the checks before commits but I also use vscode's devcontainer feature and other extensions to run checks while the code is being written.

I dont make my developers push and wait for builds, they are pretty confident in the code passing by the time they open the PR.

```
Lint -> Build -> unit-test -> Publish PreRelease -> Deploy Dev -> Integration/Perf/Smoke Test -> Publish Release -> Deploy PreProd -> Deploy Prod
```


unit test add prompt:
```
add unit test coverage for the @classification_repo.py file. only cover the missing tests. do not modify the original code, only update the tests. do not create new edge cases, only test the existing functionality. Look at the other existing test files in @unit for hints on how to format tests and mocks.
