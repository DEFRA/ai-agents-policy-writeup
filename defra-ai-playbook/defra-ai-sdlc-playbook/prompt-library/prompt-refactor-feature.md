```
Analyse the entire codebase and report out a enumerated list of opportunities to refactor the codebase, with further commentary on what priorities. Follow the guidelines in the .cusrorrules file. Ensure consistent design patterns and conventions are being used throughout the code base. Reuse and optimise where possible, but value readability and consistency over anything else.
