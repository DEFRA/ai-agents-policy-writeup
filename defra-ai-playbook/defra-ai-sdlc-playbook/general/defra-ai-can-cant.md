# Where You Can / Can't Use AI at Defra

## Why Guidance Exists

AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but they need to be used responsibly. This playbook is here to help you understand when and how to use AI tools in a way that’s safe, ethical, and aligns with how we handle data at Defra. Think of it as a common-sense guide to make the most of AI while protecting sensitive information.

## When to Use AI Tools

- **Developing Software:** Feel free to use AI tools for things like writing code, debugging, or optimizing software. Just make sure:
    - You’ve got approval from senior leadership first.
    - You check the output - don’t blindly trust what the AI generates.
- **Getting Ideas:** Need help brainstorming or solving a problem? AI tools can be great for sparking ideas or doing research, as long as you’re not using them to handle sensitive data.

## When Not to Use AI Tools

- **Sensitive or Private Information:** Don’t put anything into an AI tool that’s confidential, sensitive, or private. This includes things like:
    - Personal data (yours or anyone else’s)
    - Business secrets or financial info
    - Health records or anything protected
- **Inappropriate Content:** Avoid using AI tools to create anything that could be harmful, unethical, or inappropriate.
- **Unapproved Activities:** If you’re unsure whether you should be using AI for something, ask first.

## How to Use AI Tools Safely

- **Think Before You Input:** Treat all data as if it were your own private information. If it feels risky, don’t do it.
- **Follow Defra’s Standards:** Always handle data responsibly, sticking to Defra’s guidelines for data security and classification.
- **Review and Validate:** Double-check anything the AI generates, especially if you’re using it for important tasks like coding or making decisions.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Report Issues Quickly:** If you think there’s been a mistake, misuse, or a potential breach involving AI tools, let someone know right away.
- **Learn and Improve:** Mistakes happen. Use them as opportunities to refine how we use AI and make sure it’s working for us, not against us.

## Final Thoughts

Using AI tools is like any other tool: powerful when used well, risky when used carelessly. Use your head, follow these simple guidelines, and let’s make the most of what AI can offer while keeping everything secure and ethical.
