# General Development Guidance

This section provides foundational guidance for leveraging AI tools and techniques to develop services effectively. While many principles align with standard development practices, an AI-driven workflow introduces unique considerations. The following subsections outline best practices tailored for integrating AI tools into your development process.

## Git Branching Strategies

Effective version control is crucial for any development project, and in AI-driven workflows, **git** becomes even more essential. The iterative and experimental nature of AI development requires a robust branching strategy to ensure changes are manageable and reversible.

- **Branch per Feature/Experiment**: Create a separate branch for each new feature, bug fix, or experiment. This isolates changes and facilitates testing and code review before merging into the main branch.
- **Frequent Commits**: Commit changes often with clear messages. This practice allows AI tools to better track the evolution of code and can serve as a "breadcrumb trail" to debug issues or backtrack on decisions.
- **Rollback Readiness**: Use git to back out changes quickly if they introduce regressions or if product requirements evolve. AI-driven workflows rely on experimentation, so having a safety net is essential.
- **Pull Requests and Reviews**: Always use pull requests to merge changes into the main branch. This encourages code reviews, where AI tools can be leveraged to analyze and optimize code quality.

## High Test Coverage

High test coverage is critical in AI-accelerated development due to the rapid pace of iteration. Tests ensure that new features and updates do not introduce regressions.

- **Automated Testing**: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to cover all aspects of your application. Utilise AI tools to generate tests, but always review and refine them to match edge cases.
- **Code Coverage Metrics**: Aim for high coverage (e.g., 80% or more) but prioritize testing critical paths and business logic.
- **Regression Testing**: Regularly run regression tests to confirm that previous functionality remains intact. AI tools can help identify areas of code that may require additional testing.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrate testing into your CI pipeline to catch issues early and ensure rapid feedback during iterations.

## The Importance of Logging

Logging is a foundational practice in software development, and its importance is amplified when working with AI tools. A robust logging framework enables AI coding tools to diagnose and resolve issues more effectively.

- **Set Up Logging Early, if not first**: Establish a consistent and comprehensive logging framework at the project's outset. AI tools can use these logs to better understand application behavior and pinpoint problems.
- **Granularity and Debugging**: Ensure logs are sufficiently granular to provide context for issues. If an AI tool struggles to debug, prompt it to add more detailed logging lines to the code.
- **Structured Logging**: Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) to make logs machine-readable and easier to analyze with AI-driven log analysis tools.
- **Centralized Log Management**: Employ centralized logging solutions to aggregate logs from different environments, enabling seamless debugging and performance monitoring.

## Refactor the Code Often

AI-assisted development accelerates code generation but can also lead to technical debt if not managed carefully. Regular refactoring ensures the codebase remains clean, maintainable, and aligned with project standards.

- **Refactor Between Features**: Perform code reviews before you merge changes and refactoring between feature implementations. This helps maintain a consistent and well-organized codebase.
- **AI-Assisted Refactoring**: Use AI tools to assist in identifying areas of improvement, such as simplifying complex methods or consolidating duplicate code.  AI IDE tools allow you to 'chat' with your codebase, so you can ask it for opportunities to improve the architecture or refactoring advice.
- **Project Guidelines with .cursorrules**: Define and enforce coding standards using tools like `.cursorrules` files. These guidelines help AI tools adhere to your project’s style and architecture preferences.
- **Code Review Collaboration**: Pair AI tools with manual reviews for a comprehensive approach to refactoring. This combination leverages the AI’s speed and the developer’s judgment to achieve optimal results.

By adhering to these practices, you can maximize the potential of AI tools while maintaining a high standard of quality and reliability in your services. The rapid iteration cycle enabled by AI requires careful attention to these foundational principles to ensure sustainable and successful development.
