## Theoretical Foundations: The Knowledge Transformation Paradigm

The research question generation stage implements **progressive refinement theory** - a fundamental principle in artificial intelligence where abstract concepts are systematically transformed into specific, actionable intelligence. This transformation represents a solution to the **knowledge operationalization problem**: converting static domain knowledge into dynamic, investigatable research strategies.

## Computational Architecture: Intelligence Amplification Through Specialization

### Individual Keyword Processing: The Focused Attention Principle

**Theoretical Foundation: Attention Economics in AI Systems**

The granular keyword processing approach implements **attention economics theory** - the principle that cognitive resources (whether human or artificial) produce optimal results when focused intensively on individual tasks rather than distributed across multiple concerns simultaneously.

**Why Individual Processing Maximizes Intelligence:**

**Cognitive Load Theory:** Each keyword receives the AI's complete cognitive capacity, eliminating the **attention splitting penalty** that occurs when multiple concepts compete for processing resources.

**Context Optimization:** Individual processing enables **contextual specificity** where the AI's reasoning is perfectly aligned with the particular policy domain and implications of each keyword.

**Error Isolation Benefits:** Individual failures are contained, implementing **fault tolerance theory** where system reliability is maintained through component isolation.

**Parallel Processing Potential:** The approach naturally supports **concurrent execution patterns** where independent keyword analysis can be distributed across computational resources.

### Context Integration: Semantic Web Theory Applied to Policy Analysis
