# Research Question Generation Agent

## Overview

This agent transforms policy keywords into actionable research questions using a progressive refinement approach. It converts broad policy concepts (e.g., "agriculture funding") into specific, prioritized research queries that government researchers can immediately act upon.

**Input**: Keywords extracted from government letter issues  
**Output**: ~200 prioritized research questions organised into High/Medium/Low priority tiers  
**Purpose**: Convert abstract policy concepts into concrete research strategies

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Individual Keyword Processing

**Decision**: Process each keyword separately rather than batch processing  
**Rationale**: 
- Maximizes AI attention on each concept by splitting text blocks into focused queries
- Prevents context bleed between unrelated topics
- Avoids overloading the LLM, which would produce generic answers
- Enables parallel processing and error isolation
- Produces more focused, relevant questions

### Rich Context Integration

**Decision**: Provide complete context (letter summary, issue details, keyword definitions) to each keyword analysis  
**Rationale**:
- Enables situation-aware question generation
- Ensures questions align with original policy concerns
- Maintains traceability from questions back to source issues
- Supports government-specific research priorities

### Three-Tier Priority Framework

**Decision**: Categorise questions into High/Medium/Low priority levels  
**Rationale**:
- Optimizes resource allocation (address 80% of value with 20% of questions)
- Supports immediate vs. long-term research planning
- Enables quality control through priority-based validation
- Aligns with government decision-making timelines

**Priority Definitions**:
- **High**: Critical for immediate policy response preparation
- **Medium**: Important for comprehensive understanding and background research  
- **Low**: Useful for long-term planning and academic analysis

## Implementation Details

### Processing Architecture

```
Keyword → Context Assembly → Question Generation → Priority Assignment → Quality Validation → Structured Output
```

### Question Generation Prompt Strategy

**Template Structure**:
- Context injection (letter summary, issue details, keyword definition)
- Research framework specification (3 priority tiers)
- Output format requirements (structured, parseable)
- Government source constraints
- Quality criteria (specific, actionable, relevant)

### Data Structure Evolution

**Input Format**: Simple keyword strings  
**Output Format**: Rich objects containing:
- Question text
- Priority level
- Source keyword
- Issue relationship
- Context metadata

**Benefits**:
- Maintains complete provenance chain
- Enables quality assessment at multiple levels
- Supports debugging and human review
- Facilitates integration with downstream agents

### Error Handling Strategy

**Approach**: Graceful degradation with individual keyword isolation  
**Implementation**:
- Individual keyword failures don't affect other processing
- Partial success preferred over complete failure
- Comprehensive success rate tracking
- Quality metrics collection for system optimization

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Validation Criteria

- **Relevance**: Questions answerable through government sources
- **Specificity**: Questions specific enough to yield actionable results  
- **Comprehensiveness**: Multiple angles ensure thorough issue coverage
- **Actionability**: Questions lead to concrete research activities

### Quality Control Mechanisms

- Multi-stage validation during processing
- Pattern-based question parsing with error recovery
- Government context alignment verification
- Priority distribution balancing

## Integration & Workflow

**Previous Stage**: [Keyword Extraction](keyword-extraction.md)  
**Next Stage**: [Question Prioritization](question-prioritization.md)

**Data Flow**: Keywords → Research Questions → Prioritized Question Set

**Handoff Requirements**:
- Structured question objects with metadata
- Preserved priority classifications  
- Maintained source relationships
- Quality metrics for downstream optimization

## Technical Benefits

### Research Efficiency
- Converts abstract concepts into specific investigation pathways
- Reduces research planning overhead
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of policy issues
- Optimizes resource allocation through prioritization

### System Reliability
- Fault-tolerant architecture prevents cascade failures
- Comprehensive error tracking and recovery
- Quality validation at multiple processing stages
- Robust parsing handles AI output variations

### Operational Value
- Immediate actionability for government researchers
- Systematic coverage prevents missed investigation areas  
- Priority framework supports resource planning
- Traceability enables quality assessment and debugging
