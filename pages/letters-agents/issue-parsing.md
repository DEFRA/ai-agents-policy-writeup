# Issue Parsing: Advanced Text Processing with Graceful Degradation

## Overview

The issue parsing stage converts unstructured LLM output into reliable, structured data objects using local text processing. This stage serves as a critical validation and transformation layer that ensures data consistency despite unpredictable AI outputs.

**Purpose**: Transform AI-generated text summaries into standardised issue objects with five distinct fields (title, description, context, evidence, impact).


## Design Decisions

### Multi-Pattern Extraction Strategy

**Decision**: Implement hierarchical fallback parsing with multiple regex patterns
**Rationale**: LLM outputs vary unpredictably in format. Multiple patterns ensure robust extraction even with malformed responses.

**Implementation**:
- Primary patterns handle well-formatted output
- Progressive fallback patterns handle edge cases
- Lookahead termination prevents section bleeding
- Case-insensitive matching handles formatting variations

### Text Processing Architecture

**Decision**: Multi-stage normalization before validation
**Rationale**: Standardised text format enables reliable downstream processing and quality validation.

**Stages**:
1. Paragraph break normalization
2. Inline whitespace collapse (preserving intentional formatting)
3. Content quality validation and web artifact removal

### Local Processing Approach

**Decision**: Use regex-based parsing instead of additional LLM calls
**Rationale**: Ensures privacy compliance, predictable performance, and eliminates additional API costs for data transformation.

## Implementation Details

### Parsing Methodology

**Pattern Hierarchy**:
```
1. Structured format patterns (highest specificity)
2. Semi-structured patterns (medium specificity)  
3. Flexible extraction patterns (lowest specificity)
```

**Content Extraction Process**:
- Apply patterns in specificity order
- Extract five distinct sections per issue
- Validate extracted content meets minimum requirements
- Fall back to next pattern if extraction fails

### Quality Control Mechanisms

**Deduplication Logic**:
- Index-based deduplication (prevents duplicate issue numbers)
- Content-based deduplication (identifies similar titles/descriptions)


**Validation Checks**:
- Minimum content length requirements
- Required field presence validation
- Meaningful title validation (non-empty, substantive content)
- Sanity checking for reasonable issue counts and index ranges

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Partial Success Strategy**: Successfully parsed issues proceed even if some issues fail parsing
**Error Isolation**: Individual parsing failures don't affect other issues
**Comprehensive Logging**: All errors collected and reported without stopping processing

**Exception Handling Levels**:
1. Individual section extraction failures
2. Complete issue parsing failures  
3. Overall parsing process failures

## Data Structure Evolution

### Input → Output Transformation

**Input**: Unstructured LLM text response
**Output**: Structured issue objects with validated fields

```javascript
// Example structure (suggest adding actual data model)
{
  index: number,
  title: string,
  description: string, 
  context: string,
  evidence: string,
  impact: string
}
```

### State Management Integration

**LangGraph Integration**:
- Seamless state transitions with error preservation
- Quality checkpoints that can halt processing for critical errors
- Downstream compatibility without complex data transformation



## Technical Benefits

### Reliability Through Redundancy
- Multiple extraction patterns handle format variations
- Progressive degradation maintains partial functionality
- Quality validation prevents corrupted data propagation

### Production Readiness
- Comprehensive error reporting and metrics
- State preservation through failures
- Performance optimization (regex compilation, memory management)





## Areas for Enhancement

**Suggested Improvements**:
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML models for complex edge cases with regex fallbacks
2. **Template-Based Parsing**: Different patterns optimized for different government correspondence types
3. **Pattern Learning**: Automatic pattern refinement based on successful parsing examples

**[[UNCLEAR RATIONALE]]**: The document mentions "progressive enhancement capability" and "pattern evolution" but doesn't specify how patterns would actually evolve or what triggers changes.

## Workflow Integration

**State Flow**:
```
LLM Text Output → Pattern Matching → Content Extraction → 
Validation → Deduplication → Structured Objects → Next Stage
```

**Quality Gates**:
- Format validation checkpoint
- Content quality assessment  
- Deduplication verification
- Final structure validation
