# Internet Research Agent: Government-Source Intelligence Gathering

## Overview

The Internet Research Agent conducts targeted research using government-only sources to gather authoritative evidence for policy analysis. This component searches `.gov.uk` and `parliament.uk` domains exclusively, processes results through quality validation, and outputs structured research data for downstream synthesis.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Government-domain restricted web search
- Context-enhanced query construction  
- Automated content validation and extraction
- Graceful error handling for partial results
- Structured output with rich metadata

**Pipeline Position:** Processes prioritised research questions â†’ Outputs validated government sources for answer synthesis

## Design Decisions

### Government-Only Source Restriction

**Decision:** Restrict all searches to government domains (`.gov.uk`, `parliament.uk`)

**Rationale:**
- **Citation confidence:** All sources can be safely cited in official government responses
- **Content reliability:** Government sources undergo institutional fact-checking and legal review
- **Policy relevance:** Official content is designed for government decision-making contexts
- **Compliance alignment:** Ensures information meets government standards for evidence-based policy

**Trade-offs:**
- May miss relevant academic or industry sources
- Reduces total available information volume
- Requires comprehensive government domain list maintenance

### Enhanced Query Construction

**Decision:** Systematically enhance research questions with contextual information

**Rationale:**
- **Relevance improvement:** Context from original letters improves search precision
- **Government terminology:** Official language increases likelihood of matching government content
- **Multi-term optimisation:** Balances search specificity with result recall

### Quality-First Processing

**Decision:** Implement multiple validation checkpoints rather than accepting all results

**Rationale:**
- **Research value:** 25 high-quality results more valuable than 245 low-quality ones
- **Human compatibility:** Manageable volume for policy analyst review
- **Cost efficiency:** Focused research investment on high-impact questions

## Implementation Details

### Search Process

1. **Query Enhancement**
   - Takes research question as input
   - Adds contextual information from original letter
   - Incorporates policy domain terminology
   - Optimises for government source discovery

2. **Domain-Restricted Search**
   - Searches only approved government domains
   - Validates each result against domain whitelist
   - Rejects non-government sources automatically

3. **Content Extraction**
   - Retrieves full page content
   - Removes navigation elements and web artifacts
   - Extracts substantive policy-relevant text
   - Preserves metadata (dates, URLs, authority levels)

### Data Structure Output

Each research result includes:
- **Source authority:** Complete institutional attribution
- **Content extract:** Substantial text for analysis
- **Publication date:** For currency evaluation
- **Full provenance:** URL and institutional context

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Framework

**Authority Verification:**
- Confirms source originates from approved government domain
- Validates institutional attribution
- Ensures content meets government publication standards

**Content Quality Checks:**
- Minimum content length thresholds
- Policy relevance assessment
- Substantive information validation
- Web artifact removal

**Research Quality Metrics:**
- Success rate tracking across research operations
- Source distribution analysis (department balance)
- Content depth assessment
- Citation readiness evaluation

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:** Individual search failures don't compromise overall research process

**Partial Success Strategy:** System prioritises partial success over complete failure
- Failed searches logged for analysis
- Successful results still processed
- Minimum threshold validation ensures adequate evidence base

**Quality Validation Criteria:**
- Minimum source threshold for analytical conclusions
- Question relevance assessment
- Content depth evaluation for meaningful analysis
- Balanced representation across government institutions

## Integration

### Pipeline Interface

**Input:** Prioritised research questions from Question Prioritisation Agent
**Output:** Structured research results for Answer Synthesis Agent

**Data Flow:**
- Maintains linkage to original questions, keywords, and issues
- Preserves success/failure status and quality indicators
- Includes rich metadata for downstream analysis
- Logs failed attempts for continuous improvement

**Value Amplification:** Focused research on prioritised questions produces exponentially more analytical value than broad information gathering
