# Prompt Loading & Configuration: Template-Driven Agent Architecture

## Overview

The prompt loading system implements a **template-driven architecture** that separates AI instructions from application logic. This enables rapid iteration on agent behavior without code deployment and provides version-controlled prompt engineering for the 11-stage letter analysis pipeline.

## What We Built

### Core Components
- **Markdown-based prompt storage** for all 11 pipeline stages
- **Dynamic template loading** with LangChain integration  
- **Progressive context injection** system
- **Feature flag-driven conditional loading**
- **Graceful error handling** with fallback mechanisms

### Key Capabilities
- Load and configure prompts for all pipeline stages
- Inject dynamic context from previous processing stages
- Enable/disable agents based on feature flags
- Validate prompt templates and handle missing files
- Provide audit trail for prompt changes

## Design Decisions

### Why Markdown for Prompt Storage

**Human Readability**: Complex AI prompts benefit from markdown's formatting (headers, lists, examples) making them maintainable by both technical and non-technical staff.

**Version Control Integration**: Markdown files work seamlessly with Git workflows, providing complete audit trails and rollback capabilities essential for government compliance.

**Documentation Embedding**: Prompts serve dual purposes as AI instructions and system documentation, keeping behavior documentation current with actual implementation.

**Template Flexibility**: Supports complex formatting and conditional instructions while remaining easily editable without specialized tools.

### Why Dynamic Context Injection

**Progressive Intelligence**: Each pipeline stage receives enriched context from all previous stages, creating **intelligence amplification** where later agents make better decisions based on structured earlier outputs.

**Selective Information**: Agents receive only relevant context to avoid prompt bloat while ensuring sufficient information for quality decisions.

**Error Resilience**: Missing context variables are handled gracefully with fallbacks, ensuring pipeline continuation even with partial failures.

### Why Feature Flag Architecture

**Adaptive Processing**: Different government departments or letter types may require different processing stages. Feature flags enable workflow customization without code changes.

**Resource Optimization**: Only loads prompts for enabled features, reducing memory usage and startup time.

**Graceful Degradation**: System continues with partial functionality when individual components are disabled.

## Implementation Details

### Prompt Loading Architecture

```
Configuration → Feature Flags → Conditional Loading → Template Validation → Context Injection
```

**Loading Process**:
1. Read feature flag configuration
2. Determine required prompts based on enabled features
3. Load markdown templates from file system
4. Validate template syntax and required variables
5. Configure LangChain templates with dynamic context support

**Error Handling**:
- Individual prompt loading failures don't break the system
- Missing prompts for disabled features are handled gracefully
- Comprehensive error collection and reporting for debugging

### Context Injection System

**Progressive Context Building**:
- Stage 1: Raw letter content only
- Stage 2-4: Previous stage outputs + original content  
- Stage 5-11: Full pipeline history + structured metadata

**Template Variables**:
- `{letter_content}`: Original letter text
- `{previous_output}`: Structured output from previous stage
- `{pipeline_context}`: Accumulated metadata and findings
- `{processing_flags}`: Current feature flag state

### Prompt Engineering Patterns

**Role-Based Personas**: Each prompt establishes specific professional roles (e.g., "senior policy analyst", "environmental compliance specialist") to leverage training data associations and ensure consistent expertise application.

**Structured Output Requirements**: All prompts include explicit format specifications with examples to ensure reliable parsing by downstream agents.

**Quality Instructions**: Embedded government communication standards and plain English principles ensure outputs meet departmental requirements.

## Technical Architecture

### LangChain Integration

```python
# Template instantiation pattern
template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["letter_content", "previous_output", "pipeline_context"],
    template=markdown_prompt_content
)
```

**Benefits**:
- Dynamic variable substitution
- Template validation
- Consistent prompt formatting
- Integration with LangGraph workflows

### File System Organization

```
prompts/
├── stage-01-summarization.md
├── stage-02-issue-extraction.md
├── stage-03-keyword-identification.md
└── ...
```

**Naming Convention**: `stage-{number}-{function}.md` enables ordered loading and clear stage identification.

### Configuration Management

**Feature Flag Mapping**:
- Each processing stage maps to a feature flag
- Disabled stages skip prompt loading entirely
- Missing prompts for disabled features don't generate errors

**Environment-Specific Loading**: [[UNCLEAR RATIONALE: Document doesn't specify if different environments use different prompt sets]]

## Benefits and Rationale

### Development Velocity
- **Rapid iteration**: Prompt changes deployed without code changes
- **A/B testing**: Multiple prompt versions can be tested easily
- **Domain expert collaboration**: Non-technical staff can modify prompts directly

### System Reliability  
- **Error isolation**: Prompt failures don't cascade through pipeline
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Default prompts available for missing files
- **Validation**: Template syntax checked before deployment

### Compliance and Audit
- **Change tracking**: Complete Git history of all prompt modifications
- **Approval workflows**: Prompt changes can be reviewed separately from code
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting system behavior through prompt content

## Operational Considerations

### Performance Characteristics
- **Memory usage**: Only enabled features load prompts
- **Startup time**: Conditional loading reduces initialization overhead
- **Processing latency**: Template rendering adds minimal overhead

### Monitoring and Debugging
- **Error aggregation**: All prompt loading issues collected and reported
- **Template inspection**: Loaded prompts available for debugging
- **Context tracing**: Full variable substitution history maintained

### Maintenance Requirements
- **Prompt validation**: Regular checks for syntax and required variables
- **Version management**: Coordination between code and prompt versions
- **Testing**: Prompt changes require validation across pipeline stages
