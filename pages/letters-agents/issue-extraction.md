# Issue Extraction Agent

## Overview

The issue extraction agent decomposes complex government correspondence into discrete, analyzable policy issues. This implements a **structural decomposition approach** where complex documents are systematically broken down into manageable components for specialized downstream analysis.

**Core Function**: Transforms unstructured letters into structured issue objects, each containing five analytical dimensions (title, description, context, evidence, impact).

## Architecture Design

### Privacy-First Processing 

**Local Processing Strategy**: Continues using local Ollama models to maintain data sovereignty during sensitive content analysis.

**Design Rationale**: 
- Implements information locality principle - sensitive data processing occurs at source
- Minimizes exposure across system boundaries
- Transforms sensitive statements into generic topics suitable for later research

### Structural Decomposition Pattern

**Document as Network**: Treats government letters as complex networks where multiple policy concerns interconnect through shared concepts, stakeholders, and implications.

**Minimum Viable Issue Principle**: Each extracted issue represents the smallest meaningful analytical unit that can be processed independently while retaining sufficient context.

**Benefits**:
- Enables parallel processing of individual issues
- Provides error isolation (one issue failure doesn't affect others)
- Allows specialized attention per issue

## Implementation Details

### Five-Dimensional Issue Model

Each extracted issue contains:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive issue identification
2. **Description**: Detailed problem or concern description  
3. **Context**: Background circumstances and framing
4. **Evidence**: Specific facts, data, and examples provided
5. **Impact**: Consequences and effects described

### Multi-Pattern Parsing System

**Hierarchical Pattern Matching**: Implements multiple regex patterns applied in order of precision to handle varying degrees of structure in AI output.

**Error Recovery Strategy**:
- Multiple parsing strategies for graceful degradation
- Content validation as quality gates
- Isolation of parsing failures to prevent pipeline contamination

### Deduplication Logic

**Multi-Level Approach**:
- Index-based deduplication (same index numbers)
- Content-based similarity detection
- Quality validation filtering

**Identity Determination**: Distinguishes between syntactic identity (same structure) and semantic identity (similar meaning expressed differently).

## Quality Control Mechanisms

### Validation Framework

- **Content Validation**: Ensures meaningful information in each issue
- **Structure Verification**: Confirms all required components present
- **Boundary Checking**: Validates reasonable issue counts and content length
- **Progressive Quality Gates**: Data quality monitored and improved through successive stages

### Error Handling

**Partial Success Philosophy**: Maximizes value extraction under uncertainty - system continues processing even with partial failures.

**Fault Containment**: Individual issue parsing failures are isolated and don't propagate to compromise overall functionality.

## Data Structure Evolution

### From Text to Knowledge Objects

**Progressive Enrichment**: Raw text transforms through successive stages:
```
Raw Letter Text → Structured Summary → Discrete Issues → Rich Issue Objects
```

## Integration Patterns

### Upstream Integration
**Input**: Structured letter summaries from [Letter Summarization](letter-summarization.md) stage

### Downstream Integration  
**Output**: Individual issue objects for [Issue Parsing](issue-parsing.md) stage

**Parallel Processing Benefits**:
- Each issue processed independently 
- Embarrassingly parallel computation model
- Optimal scalability characteristics

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why Structural Decomposition?

1. **Scalability**: Enables parallel processing vs. monolithic analysis
2. **Quality**: Individual attention per issue improves analytical depth
3. **Error Isolation**: Component failures don't cascade
4. **Specialization**: Downstream agents can optimize for specific issue types

### Why Local Processing Continues?

**Privacy-Capability Frontier**: Balances maximum analytical capability with complete data sovereignty requirements.

**Cost Optimization**: Reserves expensive cloud models for abstracted, high-value tasks.

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- **Without decomposition**: O(n³) scaling (issues × keywords × questions)
- **With decomposition**: O(n) scaling through parallel processing
- **Typical reduction**: ~10x fewer operations per letter

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Local Ollama instance
- LangGraph state management
- Text processing utilities

### Resource Requirements
- Memory: Proportional to letter length and issue count
- Processing: CPU-bound for text analysis
- Storage: Minimal - structured objects only

### Error Boundaries
- Individual issue extraction failures
- Pattern matching degradation
- Content validation rejections
- Deduplication logic failures

**Key Insights**: This implementation demonstrates how divide-and-conquer algorithmic principles can be applied to document analysis, enabling better scaling characteristics than monolithic approaches while maintaining quality through specialized attention and error isolation.
