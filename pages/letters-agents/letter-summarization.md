# Letter Summarization Agent

## Overview

The letter summarization agent converts government correspondence into structured, privacy-preserving summaries. It processes sensitive documents locally using Ollama, extracting key information while removing personally identifiable details.

**Purpose**: Enable analysis of government letters without compromising privacy or sending sensitive data to external services.

**Input**: Raw government correspondence (letters, emails, complaints)  
**Output**: Structured 4-dimensional summaries with privacy-safe abstractions

## Design Decisions

### Why Local Processing Only

**Decision**: Use only local Ollama models for summarization, never cloud-based LLMs.

**Rationale**: 
- Maintains complete data sovereignty over sensitive government correspondence
- Ensures compliance with UK government data handling requirements
- Eliminates external dependencies for processing confidential information
- Provides operational independence from internet connectivity

**Trade-offs**: 
- Local models have less sophisticated reasoning than cloud models like GPT-4
- Processing may be slower than cloud alternatives
- Requires local computational resources

### Why 4-Dimensional Summary Structure

**Decision**: Structure all summaries into exactly 4 categories:
1. Main issues and concerns
2. Key stakeholders and entities  
3. Background context and circumstances
4. Requests, expectations, and desired outcomes

**Rationale**:
- Ensures comprehensive coverage without information gaps
- Provides consistent structure for downstream processing
- Enables systematic quality validation
- Facilitates efficient human review

### Why Semantic Compression Approach

**Decision**: Remove sensitive details while preserving essential meaning and context.

**Rationale**:
- Enables downstream analysis without privacy compromise
- Maintains analytical utility while meeting compliance requirements
- Creates safe abstractions that can cross organizational boundaries
- Supports human review without exposing confidential information

## Implementation Details

### Local Processing Architecture

```
Raw Letter → Local Ollama → Privacy-Safe Summary → Downstream Processing
```

**Components**:
- **Ollama Runtime**: Local LLM processing environment
- **Summarization Prompts**: Structured templates for consistent output
- **Quality Validators**: Multi-dimensional completeness checks

### Summarization Process

1. **Input Validation**: Verify document format and content accessibility
2. **Semantic Extraction**: Apply 4-dimensional prompt templates
3. **Abstraction Processing**: Remove sensitive identifiers while preserving context
4. **Quality Assessment**: Validate completeness across all dimensions
5. **Structured Output**: Generate standardized summary object

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

**Template Structure**:
- Clear instructions for each summary dimension
- Specific guidance on privacy abstraction levels
- Examples of appropriate detail retention vs removal
- Quality validation checkpoints

**Key Patterns**:
- Context-aware abstraction (preserve policy-relevant details, remove personal identifiers)
- Relationship preservation (maintain connections between concepts)
- Thematic consistency (ensure coherent narrative flow)

### Data Structures

**Input**: Unstructured text documents
**Output**: Rich summary objects containing:

```
{
  "summary_content": {
    "main_issues": ["issue1", "issue2"],
    "stakeholders": ["entity1", "entity2"], 
    "background": "contextual information",
    "requests": ["request1", "request2"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "abstraction_level": "high|medium|low",
    "sensitive_details_removed": ["types"],
    "processing_model": "ollama_model_name",
    "quality_score": 0.85
  }
}
```

## Privacy and Security

### Information Boundaries

**Local Processing Boundary**: All sensitive content processing occurs within local environment
**Abstraction Boundary**: Only privacy-safe summaries cross to external processing
**Trust Boundary**: Clear separation between sensitive and safe processing zones

### Abstraction Strategy

**Preserve**: Policy themes, contextual background, analytical relationships, stakeholder roles
**Abstract**: Personal names, specific addresses, private details, confidential identifiers
**Remove**: Sensitive information not required for analysis

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Metrics

- **Completeness**: All 4 dimensions populated with relevant content
- **Privacy Protection**: No sensitive identifiers in output
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and thematic consistency maintained
- **Utility**: Sufficient detail preserved for downstream analysis

### Human Review Integration

**Review Process**: 
1. Automated quality checks
2. Human expert validation
3. Feedback integration for improvement

**Review Focuses**:
- Privacy compliance verification
- Analytical utility assessment  
- Summary accuracy validation

## Integration Architecture

### Downstream Handoff

**Secure Transition**: Privacy-safe summaries feed directly into issue extraction agent
**Data Flow**: Structured summaries → Issue identification → Keyword extraction → Research prioritization

**Benefits**:
- Enables use of more capable models for subsequent processing
- Maintains privacy protection throughout pipeline
- Preserves analytical quality through transformations

## Operational Benefits

### Privacy and Compliance
- **Zero External Exposure**: No sensitive data leaves local environment
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets UK government data handling requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Complete processing history for compliance verification

### Processing Efficiency  
- **Semantic Compression**: Reduces data volume while preserving meaning
- **Structured Output**: Optimized for downstream processing
- **Quality Consistency**: Standardized approach ensures reliable results

### Human-AI Collaboration
- **Expert Review**: Structured outputs facilitate human validation
- **Transparent Processing**: Clear abstraction methodology enables confident deployment
- **Scalable Operation**: Consistent quality across varying document types
