# Key Elements Agent

## Overview

The Key Elements Agent transforms the filtered Parliamentary Questions into structured, categorised information that enables coherent response generation. It systematically extracts and organises critical policy components, stakeholder relationships, and factual foundations.

**Input**: Filtered Parliamentary Questions from Filter Agent  
**Output**: Structured information scaffold for Response Agent  

## Design Decisions

### Why Structured Information Extraction?

**Problem**: Raw Parliamentary content contains complex, interwoven information that leads to:
- Information fragmentation and context loss
- Inconsistent coverage of important topics  
- Disorganised responses failing Parliamentary standards

**Solution**: Systematic extraction into predefined categories ensures:
- Complete coverage of essential information types
- Preserved relationships between policies, stakeholders, and timelines
- Organised foundation for coherent response construction

### Why Pre-Generation Organisation?

**Cognitive Load Distribution**: Separating information extraction from response generation allows each agent to specialise and reduces errors.

**Template-Driven Approach**: Pre-defined categories ensure comprehensive coverage and enable quality standardisation across different query types.

## Implementation Details

### Core Processing Framework

The agent follows a 5-step processing pipeline:

#### Step 1: Question Comprehension
- Identify subject, scope, and specific information requirements
- Establish clear understanding for downstream processing

#### Step 2: Context & Intent Analysis
Analyses multiple dimensions:
- **Impact Classification**: Economic/Environmental/Social/Operational
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Businesses/consumers/government/environment
- **Specific Aspects**: Costs/compliance/implementation/effectiveness
- **Mismatch Detection**: Flag when search results don't match user question intent

#### Step 3: Information Extraction
Systematic extraction of:
- Facts, figures, and statistics
- Policy positions and government commitments
- Temporal information (dates, deadlines, timelines)
- Programmes and initiatives
- Stakeholder mapping
- Evidence of government action

#### Step 4: Categorisation Framework
Classification into 4 specific categories:
1. **Direct Answers**: Information directly addressing the question
2. **Supporting Context**: Related policies providing background
3. **Evidence & Data**: Assessments, consultations, published data
4. **Timeline Information**: Dates and sequencing of relevant actions

#### Step 5: Ranking and Prioritisation
Multi-factor ranking by:
- **Relevance**: High/Medium/Low relevance to user question
- **Recency**: Preference for up-to-date information
- **Authority**: Official assessments > formal consultations > general statements

### Required Output Format

**Structure**: All relevant key elements that help construct the answer  
**Element Format**: 

```
[Category - Relevance] [Extracted information] *(Source: PQ [number] - [date])*
```  

**Requirements**: 
- Every element must include category, relevance ranking, extracted fact, and source
- British English spelling and grammar
- Complete source attribution with PQ reference and date

**Example Output Structure**:
```
[Direct Answer - High] The Government committed Â£2.1 billion for circular economy initiatives in 2023-2025. *(Source: PQ 12345 - 15 March 2024)*

[Evidence & Data - High] Impact assessment published February 2024 estimates 15% reduction in packaging waste by 2026. *(Source: PQ 23456 - 20 March 2024)*
```

## Technical Architecture

### Information Categorisation

**Multi-Dimensional Classification**: Processes Parliamentary content across multiple analytical dimensions simultaneously using:

- **Policy Analysis**: Extraction of policies, initiatives, legislative context, implementation status
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Government departments, political actors, external entities, relationship analysis
- **Factual Elements**: Temporal context, quantitative data, geographic scope
- **Thematic Analysis**: Core themes, cross-cutting issues, priority areas

### Processing Methodology

**Natural Language Processing**:
- Entity recognition for key entities across categories
- Relationship extraction between identified entities
- Context preservation from original Parliamentary content
- Temporal sequencing for chronological organisation

**Quality Assurance Integration**:
- Completeness verification across information categories
- Accuracy validation through cross-referencing
- Relevance filtering based on user query
- Redundancy elimination

## Quality Assurance

### Extraction Validation

**Coverage Verification**:
- All major information categories addressed
- Comprehensive detail for quality response generation
- Gap detection for missing critical information

**Accuracy Validation**:
- Internal consistency of extracted information
- Source verification against original Parliamentary content
- Context and relationship preservation
- Error detection and correction

## Integration Points

### Input Requirements
- **Format**: 5 filtered Parliamentary Questions with relevance metadata
- **Quality**: Questions must meet Filter Agent output standards
- **Structure**: Consistent Parliamentary Question formatting

### Output Specifications
- **Format**: Structured information optimised for Response Agent consumption
- **Quality**: Comprehensive coverage with confidence indicators
- **Compatibility**: JSON-compatible structure for downstream processing

### State Management Integration
Updates LangGraph state with:
```python
key_elements: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]  # Extracted structured information
```

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Efficiency
- **Parallel Extraction**: Simultaneous processing across information categories [[CHECK DETAIL: Is this actually implemented?]]
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple Parliamentary Questions
- **Resource Optimisation**: Balanced computational usage

### Scalability
- **Category Adaptation**: Flexible structure for different policy domains
- **Query-Specific Emphasis**: Adaptive extraction based on question characteristics
- **Caching Potential**: Pattern recognition for similar Parliamentary content [[UNCLEAR RATIONALE: Is caching implemented or just potential?]]

## Rationale Summary

### Why This Agent Exists
1. **Information Complexity**: Parliamentary content requires systematic organisation
2. **Response Quality**: Structured input enables higher-quality response generation
3. **Consistency**: Standardised extraction ensures reliable processing
4. **Specialisation**: Dedicated extraction allows response agent to focus on synthesis

### Key Design Trade-offs
- **Completeness vs. Conciseness**: Extracts all relevant elements while maintaining downstream processing efficiency
- **Automation vs. Accuracy**: Structured extraction reduces manual review but requires robust validation
- **Flexibility vs. Standardisation**: Fixed categories ensure consistency but may miss novel information patterns
