# Key Elements Agent

## Overview
The Key Elements Agent transforms filtered Parliamentary Questions into structured, categorized information scaffolding that enables coherent, comprehensive response generation by systematically extracting and organizing critical policy components, stakeholder relationships, and factual foundations.

## Prompt Instructions & Agent Behavior

### Core Prompt Mission
The Key Elements Agent is positioned as a **specialist research assistant in Defra's Circular Economy Policy team** with expertise in extracting and structuring information from Parliamentary Questions. The prompt establishes the agent as a domain expert responsible for comprehensive information analysis and systematic organization.

### Specific Task Instructions
The prompt provides a detailed 5-step processing framework:

**Step 1 - Comprehension**: 
- **Task**: Identify the subject, scope, and specific information requirements of the new Parliamentary Question
- **Purpose**: Establish clear understanding of what information is needed for response generation

**Step 2 - Question Context & Intent Analysis**:
The prompt requires sophisticated contextual analysis across multiple dimensions:
- **Impact Type Classification**: Economic/Financial vs Environmental vs Social vs Operational impacts
- **Sector/Stakeholder Focus**: Businesses, consumers, government, environment identification
- **Specific Aspect Targeting**: Costs, compliance, implementation, effectiveness analysis
- **Mismatch Detection**: Flag when search results address different concerns than the user question

**Step 3 - Information Extraction**:
The prompt instructs systematic extraction of:
- **Facts, Figures, and Statistics**: Quantitative data and measurable information
- **Policy Positions and Commitments**: Government stances and official commitments
- **Temporal Information**: Dates of assessments, consultations, implementations
- **Programs and Initiatives**: Specific schemes, programs, or policy implementations
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Key affected parties and sectors
- **Evidence of Action**: Government activities and considerations

**Step 4 - Categorization Framework**:
The prompt requires classification into four specific categories:
1. **Direct Answers**: Information that directly addresses the new question
2. **Supporting Context**: Related policies or initiatives providing background
3. **Evidence & Data**: Specific assessments, consultations, or published data
4. **Timeline Information**: Dates and sequencing of relevant actions

**Step 5 - Ranking and Prioritization**:
The prompt mandates multi-factor ranking by:
- **Relevance**: High/Medium/Low relevance to the user question
- **Recency**: Preference for most up-to-date information
- **Authority**: Official assessments > formal consultations > general statements

### Required Output Format
The prompt specifies exact formatting requirements:
- **Structure**: 5-7 key elements maximum for optimal downstream processing
- **Element Format**: [Category - Relevance] [Extracted information] *(Source: PQ [number] - [date])*
- **Source Attribution**: Every element must include PQ reference number and date
- **Completeness**: Each element must include category, relevance ranking, extracted fact, and source

### British English Compliance
The prompt mandates **British English spelling and grammar conventions**, ensuring consistency with Parliamentary standards and appropriate governmental language use throughout the extraction process.

### Focus Areas and Priorities
The prompt emphasizes specific extraction priorities:
- **Data Points Over Statements**: Prioritize specific, measurable information over general statements
- **Date Inclusion**: Include temporal context wherever mentioned in sources
- **Assessment Documentation**: Note any mentioned assessments or consultations
- **Government Positions**: Capture clear governmental positions and stances
- **Impact Figures**: Identify cost and impact figures where available
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Note stakeholder consultation and engagement activities

### Domain-Specific Context
The prompt positions the agent within **Defra's Circular Economy Policy team**, providing specialized context for:
- **Policy Domain Knowledge**: Understanding of circular economy policy frameworks
- **Governmental Perspective**: Appropriate focus on official government actions and positions
- **Stakeholder Awareness**: Recognition of relevant industry sectors and affected parties

## Technical Design Philosophy

### Why Structured Information Extraction?

**Problem with Unstructured Processing**:
- **Information Fragmentation**: Raw Parliamentary content contains complex, interwoven information that's difficult to process systematically
- **Context Loss**: Without structure, relationships between policies, stakeholders, and timelines become unclear
- **Inconsistent Coverage**: Ad-hoc information extraction leads to gaps in important topics or over-emphasis on prominent but less relevant details
- **Response Incoherence**: Unstructured information results in disorganized, incomplete responses that fail Parliamentary standards

**Structured Extraction Benefits**:
- **Systematic Coverage**: Ensures all critical information categories are consistently addressed
- **Relationship Preservation**: Maintains connections between policies, stakeholders, dates, and implications
- **Response Scaffolding**: Provides organized foundation that guides coherent response construction
- **Quality Assurance**: Enables verification that responses address all essential elements

### Why Pre-Generation Organization?

**Cognitive Load Distribution**:
- **Specialized Processing**: Dedicated extraction agent optimizes for information organization
- **Response Generation Focus**: Allows response agent to concentrate on language, tone, and synthesis
- **Error Reduction**: Systematic extraction reduces the likelihood of missing critical information
- **Consistency Enhancement**: Standardized structure leads to more reliable response quality

**Template-Driven Approach**:
- **Comprehensive Categories**: Pre-defined categories ensure complete coverage of Parliamentary contexts
- **Scalable Framework**: Structure adapts to different query types and policy domains
- **Quality Standardization**: Consistent organization enables predictable response quality
- **Audit Trail**: Structured extraction provides clear visibility into information processing
