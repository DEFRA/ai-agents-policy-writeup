# Filter Agent

## Overview
The Filter Agent serves as an intelligent quality gate, applying sophisticated LLM-powered reasoning to transform semantic search results into a curated set of highly relevant Parliamentary Questions that form the foundation for accurate response generation.

## Prompt Instructions & Agent Behavior

### Core Prompt Mission
The Filter Agent operates as a **relevance assessment agent** with a focused mandate to evaluate search results from previous Parliamentary Questions and determine their utility for answering user queries. The prompt positions the agent as a quality gatekeeper that must make intelligent decisions about information relevance.

### Specific Task Instructions
The prompt instructs the agent to:

**Primary Objective**: Assess each search result and determine if it contains useful information to assist in answering the user's question, with a target of identifying 4-5 useful results for comprehensive coverage.

**Evaluation Framework**: The prompt provides four specific criteria for assessment:
1. **Relevance**: Direct assessment of whether the result addresses the user's question or provides related useful information
2. **Topic Alignment**: Verification that the result covers the same general topic/domain as the user's question
3. **Information Value**: Evaluation of whether the result contains information that could help build a quality answer
4. **Context Utility**: Assessment of whether the result provides helpful context or background information

**Quality Guidelines**: The prompt instructs the agent to:
- **Be moderately selective**: Recognizing that semantic similarity often indicates genuine relevance
- **Include partial answers**: Incorporating results that provide useful context even if not complete answers
- **Consider synthesis potential**: Understanding that multiple related results can build comprehensive responses
- **Target optimal coverage**: Aiming for 4-5 relevant results to ensure good coverage without cognitive overload

**Response Format**: The prompt requires simple, binary decisions:
- Output only "RELEVANT" or "IRRELEVANT" for each search result
- No explanations or reasoning required in the output
- Clean, parseable format for downstream processing

### British English Compliance
The prompt specifically mandates **British English spelling and grammar conventions**, ensuring consistency with Parliamentary standards and maintaining appropriate governmental language conventions throughout the assessment process.

### Quality Standards Integration
The prompt emphasizes **moderate selectivity** rather than aggressive filtering, recognizing that:
- Semantic similarity often indicates genuine relevance for Parliamentary content
- Multiple related results can contribute to building comprehensive responses
- Partial answers and contextual information have value in Parliamentary Question responses
- Balance between thoroughness and efficiency is essential for workflow optimization

## Technical Design Rationale

### Why LLM-Powered Filtering Over Algorithmic Approaches?

**Limitations of Algorithmic Filtering**:
- **Semantic Similarity Gaps**: Vector similarity can identify related content but may miss contextual relevance
- **Surface-Level Matching**: Algorithmic approaches focus on statistical patterns rather than meaning
- **Context Insensitivity**: Cannot understand nuanced relationships between policies and their implications
- **Static Rule Limitations**: Predefined rules cannot adapt to novel query patterns or Parliamentary contexts

**LLM Filtering Advantages**:
- **Contextual Understanding**: Comprehends the intent behind user queries and content relationships
- **Nuanced Reasoning**: Evaluates relevance based on meaning, not just similarity scores
- **Adaptive Assessment**: Handles novel situations and complex Parliamentary relationships
- **Quality Differentiation**: Distinguishes between superficial and substantive relevance

### Why Reduce from 10 to 5 Results?

**Cognitive Load Management**:
- **Downstream Optimization**: Reduces processing burden on subsequent agents
- **Quality Concentration**: Focuses attention on highest-quality sources
- **Response Coherence**: Prevents fragmented responses from too many competing sources
- **Processing Efficiency**: Optimizes speed without sacrificing quality

**Quality vs. Quantity Trade-off**:
- **Signal-to-Noise Improvement**: Eliminates marginally relevant results that degrade response quality
- **Relevance Concentration**: Ensures all retained results contribute meaningfully to the response
- **Consistency Enhancement**: Reduces variability in response quality from inconsistent sources

## Primary Function
Applies LLM-powered relevance assessment to reduce search results from 10 to 5 most contextually relevant questions. Eliminates tangentially related or outdated information through sophisticated reasoning about Parliamentary context and user intent.

## Technical Implementation

- **Context Preservation**: Maintains user query context throughout the assessment process
- **Output Structuring**: Ensures consistent, parseable output format for downstream processing

### Multi-Dimensional Relevance Assessment

**Direct Relevance Analysis**:
- **Query Intent Matching**: Evaluates how well each result addresses the specific user question
- **Topic Alignment**: Assesses thematic consistency between query and Parliamentary content
- **Scope Appropriateness**: Ensures results match the breadth and specificity of the user inquiry

**Contextual Quality Evaluation**:
- **Source Authority**: Considers the credibility and official status of Parliamentary sources
- **Information Completeness**: Evaluates whether results provide sufficient detail for response generation
- **Factual Accuracy**: Assesses the reliability and verifiability of information presented

**Temporal Relevance Assessment**:
- **Currency Evaluation**: Prioritizes recent information while preserving historically significant context
- **Policy Evolution**: Understands how policies and positions have changed over time
- **Superseded Information**: Identifies and filters outdated or replaced policy positions

## Core Capabilities

### Advanced Reasoning Mechanisms

**Contextual Analysis**:
**Technical Implementation**: Multi-layer reasoning that considers query intent, Parliamentary context, and result content simultaneously
**Benefits**: Eliminates results that are semantically similar but contextually irrelevant

**Quality Filtering**:
**Technical Implementation**: Systematic evaluation of source authority, information completeness, and factual reliability
**Benefits**: Ensures downstream agents work with high-quality, authoritative information sources

**Currency Assessment**:
**Technical Implementation**: Temporal analysis that prioritizes current information while preserving relevant historical context
**Benefits**: Prevents responses based on outdated or superseded policy positions

**Relevance Scoring**:
**Technical Implementation**: Sophisticated reasoning that goes beyond statistical similarity to assess true utility for response generation
**Benefits**: Concentrates processing on results that will contribute most effectively to quality responses

### Intelligent Content Curation

**Thematic Coherence**:
- **Topic Clustering**: Groups related results to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Perspective Balance**: Maintains multiple viewpoints when appropriate for balanced responses
- **Depth vs. Breadth**: Balances detailed coverage with comprehensive scope

**Information Hierarchy**:
- **Primary Sources**: Prioritizes official Parliamentary records and government statements
- **Supporting Context**: Includes relevant background information that enhances understanding
- **Factual Foundation**: Ensures sufficient factual basis for authoritative response generation

## Assessment Criteria

### Direct Relevance Evaluation
**Question**: How closely does the content match the query intent?
**Technical Process**: Natural language understanding analysis comparing user query semantics with result content
**Decision Logic**: Results must directly address the question asked, not just share related topics

### Information Quality Assessment
**Question**: Is the source authoritative and well-structured?
**Technical Process**: Multi-factor evaluation of source credibility, information completeness, and structural clarity
**Decision Logic**: Only high-quality sources that enable confident response generation are retained
