## Overview

Although not strictly a workflow, learning new skills can also be accelerated with AI.

AI can accelerate coding and learning, but there’s a risk it might weaken developers’ grasp of core software principles. Or even worse - prevent these skills from developing in new software developers.
To counter this, we designed a learning rule to be added to Cursor’s global settings.

## Why this Prompt Works

- **Explains Core Concepts:** Details core design and engineering principals being used when generating code.
- **Faster Learning:** Real-time feedback and explanations speed up understanding.
- **Diverse Solutions:** Offers multiple approaches to solve problems.
- **Active Engagement:** Encourages users to think critically about code choices.
- **Testing Knowledge:** The AI will prompt the user with questioning about the code changes that have been made to assess knowledge,

## Conclusion

This rule ensures that AI helps developers write code faster while also deepening their understanding of essential software practices.
