# Documentation and Feedback

## Overview

AI tools make it easier to create and maintain clear documentation. This guide explains how to use AI effectively for documentation and how to use that documentation to improve your AI tools.

## Keep documentation up to date

### Regular updates

Update your documentation each time you:
- Add a new feature
- Change existing code
- Fix a bug

This helps both your team and the AI tools understand your code better.

Use the [prompt-update-documentation](../prompt-library/prompt-update-documentation.md) prompt to help AI tools update documentation.

### Make documentation part of development

Document as you work, not as an afterthought. AI tools can help you write:
- Function descriptions
- Usage guides
- API documentation

## Create visual documentation

### Visual aids

AI tools can create diagrams to explain your code:

- **Sequence diagrams**: Show how things work together using Mermaid
- **Data models**: Show how your data is structured

These visuals help everyone understand your system better.

## Use documentation to improve AI

### Documentation as a knowledge base

Good documentation helps AI tools:
- Understand your code better
- Avoid mistakes
- Create solutions that match your existing code

### Scale as you grow

As your code grows, good documentation becomes more important. Without it, AI tools become less effective. Keep improving your documentation to help both your team and AI work better.

## Best practices

1. Include documentation in your 'definition of done'
2. Use AI to write and check documentation
3. Use tools like Mermaid for diagrams
4. Check documentation regularly to keep it accurate
